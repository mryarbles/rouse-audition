Market + Auction Value CHALLENGE:
--------------------

Included in this email is the mocked API response for two sets of equipment. Spend some time visualizing and understanding the data structure.
For each year, there are two ratios, auctionRatio and MarketRatio. The cost is per set of equipment (ID).
If we want to calculate the 'value' of a set and year, we multiply the ratio for that year with the cost in saleDetails for that set.
MarketValue = {cost} * {marketRatio}
AuctionValue = {cost} * {auctionRatio}

Note: This challenge should be done in Angular.
You can use some freedom in how you implement it, as long as the basic conditions are met and you keep it simple.

Task #1 - Create a page that has inputs for the model id and year, and displays the calculated values (Market and Auction)

Task #2 - Add validation to ensure it handles incorrect inputs (EX: ID doesn't exist) graciously, you can do so however you prefer.

Task #3 - Add code to test your function, pass it the parameters below and validate.
Year 2007 ID 67352, Year 2011 ID 87964

Add additional functionality as you want.

Send us only the code of your final solution. Keep the project, you might be asked to screenshare and run it in a future interview.
